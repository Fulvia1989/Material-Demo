        Rosetta's lander Philae is named after an island in the Nile river, 
        where archaeologists found an inscription on an obelisk that confirmed 
        their interpretation of the Rosetta Stone hyeroglyphics texts.
        As The Rosetta Stone provided the key to an ancient civilization,ESAâ€™s Rosetta mission 
        will allow scientists to unlock the mysteries of the oldest building blocks of our Solar System: comets.
